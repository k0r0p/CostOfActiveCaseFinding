Cost of Active Case Finding
=======================
This is the public repository for source code from the manuscript "How much is tuberculosis screening worth? Estimating the value of active case finding for tuberculosis in South Africa, China, and India". While I have tried to comment relavent portions, it is not perfect and is released in the sprit of ["Publish your code, it's good enough"](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467753a.html). If you have any questions about the code please feel free to conact me at azman@jhu.edu.
