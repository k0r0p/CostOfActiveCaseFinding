Cost of Active Case Finding
=======================
This is the public repository for source code from the manuscript "How Much is TB Screening Worth? Estimating the Value of Active Case Finding for Tuberculosis" (in review). While I have tried to comment relavent portions, it is not perfect and is released in the sprit of ["Publish your code, it's good enough"](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467753a.html).
